# About me
Hi, I'm Taiki!
I am a master student at [the System Control Laboratory](https://www.scl.ipc.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp) 
at [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) under the supervision of 
[Prof. Masayuki Fujita](http://www.fl.ctrl.titech.ac.jp/member/fujita/fujitae.html).
Also, I am currently an exchange student at [ETH Z√ºrich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) from September 2022.

I am interested in Systems and Control and fascinated with its versatility and elegance.
I am enjoying learning about control in various scientific/engineering fields and 
I hope that I could get a "systematic‚Äù viewpoint of the world üåç
