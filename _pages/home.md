# About me
I am a master's student at the [System Control Laboratory](https://www.scl.ipc.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp) 
at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) under the supervision of 
[Prof. Masayuki Fujita](http://www.fl.ctrl.titech.ac.jp/member/fujita/fujitae.html).
I received the B.S. degree in mathematical engineering and information physics from the University of Tokyo, Japan, in 2022.

<!-- I am interested in Systems and Control and fascinated with its versatility and elegance.
I am enjoying learning about control in various scientific/engineering fields and 
I hope that I could get a "systematic” viewpoint of the world 🌍 -->

<!-- The researches can be seen from [here](./researches). -->
