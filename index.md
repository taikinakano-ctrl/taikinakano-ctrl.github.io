<!-- # About me -->

## Short Bio

I am a master's student at the [System Control Laboratory](https://www.scl.ipc.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp) 
at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) under the supervision of 
[Prof. Masayuki Fujita](http://www.fl.ctrl.titech.ac.jp/member/fujita/fujitae.html).
I was an exchange student at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) from 2022 until 2023 and
did student projects
under [Prof. Melanie Zeilinger](https://idsc.ethz.ch/the-institute/people/person-detail.MTQyNzM3.TGlzdC82MjMsMjA4ODk3NDEzOQ==.html) at the [Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control (IDSC)](https://idsc.ethz.ch/)
and [Prof. John Lygeros](https://control.ee.ethz.ch/people/profile.john-lygeros.html)
at [Automatic Control Lab (IfA)](https://control.ee.ethz.ch/).
I received the B.S. degree in mathematical engineering and information physics from the University of Tokyo, Japan, in 2022.


<!-- ## Research Interests

I am interested in Systems and Control and fascinated with its versatility and elegance.
I am enjoying learning about control in various scientific/engineering fields and 
I hope that I could get a "systematic” viewpoint of the world 🌍 -->

## Research Topics

I am interested in theoretical aspects of control theory, which includes:
- Data-driven / Learning-based control
- Control of multi-agents systems.
